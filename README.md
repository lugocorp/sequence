# Sequence Dungeons
This is a rogue-like game set in an Indigenous fantasy world where you build an ever-shifting party to overcome a string of events.
The core of the game is around strategic choice making.
You'll have clear ideas of the immediate outcome of your choices but only a speculation about later consequences.
The game is written in TypeScript and runs on mobile platforms using Cordova.

## Commands
We have a number of `npm` commands:
- `start` runs the game server and listens for code changes
- `compile` builds all the TypeScript code
- `format` makes the code pretty and lints everything
- `audit` checks the game data for any illegal values
- `android` compiles and deploys the game to an android device
